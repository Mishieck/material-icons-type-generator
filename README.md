# Material Icons Type Generator

Generate TypeScript type definition for Material Icon Names. The type is
generated using bun. You can either copy the contents of the file file
(`material-icons-types.ts`) or clone the repo and run the script
`bun run index.ts` to get the latest type definitions. The script uses the
GitHub API through the library `octokit`. Therefore, you need to use an access
token.
